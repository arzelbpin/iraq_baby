2,Amazon Customer,Good for avoiding overweight bag fees,0,2018-08-11,5.0,No idea how accurate this one is but generally these are great at making sure you skate under baggage weight limits!,116
3,Cristina G.,Great way to avoid baggage fees!,0,2018-08-10,5.0,Love this scale. It gives you the weight of your bags in pounds and kilos. It is a great little tool if you travel a lot and want to avoid extra baggage fees.,158
4,Miss Lark,I can't believe amazon endorsed this at all...,0,2018-08-08,1.0,This product is worthless.  It changes itself from screen to screen or just crashes when you try to lift the bag as per instructions.  Better off using a bathroom scale and doing the math...Highly disappointed- do not waste your money.,235
5,abky,Handy tool for someone who is always pushing the upper limit of baggage allowances.,0,2018-08-07,5.0,"Lightweight scale that is easy to use. Seems reliable to me; I weighed my bag at home at 49.7 lbs and it weighed on the airline scale at 49.6 lbs. It often wants to default back to kg, after I set it to lbs, though, and if I don't notice it right away assume I'm well under the baggage allowance. And this scale makes it much easier than my old method, which was to weight myself on a bath scale, and then weigh myself holding my heavy suitcase on the bath scale (as it never seemed to work correctly just setting the suitcase on the scale alone).",547

11,Brave New Bookshelves,"Works perfectly, small and light enough to pack for travel",0,2018-08-05,5.0,"If you're someone who regularly runs up against luggage weight limits, you need this in your life. Now instead of forcing my partner to jury-rig a system for weighing suitcases on the bathroom scale, I just force him to lift the suitcase using this! It's ten times easier, and we can do it while we're traveling and don't have a bathroom scale. It's win/win. He gets to keep my souvenir buying under control, and we're don't have to worry about overweight baggage fees.
You do have to be reasonably strong; basically you loop the strap around the handle of what you're weighing, then lift straight up a few inches until the suitcase is off the ground, hanging by the strap. I find I can do about 50 lb without a problem, and I'd say I'm average strength for a mid-30s female. However, shorter people may have a harder time lifting big suitcases high enough-- I'm usually lifting the scale to about chest height to get a big suitcase off the ground, and I'm 5'10"". If I were several inches shorter, I'd probably want to stand on a stair or step-stool to make the lifting more efficient. (Lifting something above your chest while keeping it in front of you is really hard, and probably terrible for your back.)
We've had this scale for a couple years now, and continue to be pleased with its accuracy. FYI,  it uses the large watch batteries, but I don't think we've had to replace them yet.",1389

I had a 50lb suitcase and lifting it in front of you with both hands while trying to read the led screen was awkward. Once I got the bag lifted up I heard a pop in my back and it’s never been the same, and that was 3 months ago. You would be better off, especially with heavy bags, to weigh yourself then weigh yourself holding the suitcase.",460

Put in a fresh battery - just in case. It turned on right on, shown 0 after a second. But as soon as there is any pull on the hook, even the light one of less than a pound it turns off. Tried multiple times with the same result - turns right on but as soon as you pull just a tiny bit on the actual belt it's off. Useless.

I do notice that nearly 40% of the time while using this, the screen just turns off. In fact the entire gadget turns off until I set the luggage down, redo the process (sometimes up to 4 times for one use). Luckily I do not weigh my luggage in a hurry and this product is very fairly priced, but when purchasing anything I expect it to work basically every time for it's indented use. I am no expert, but I am assuming it is the shaking while lifting the suitcase that may cause the battery to very briefly become loose.",653

My scale arrived with a dead battery but I had a few extra of the type needed kicking around.  If you use this for bows then here's some advice; Don't use this scale by pulling back your string with it as if you are firing an arrow.  While that can work, it's not as reliable as placing your bow on a carpeted floor, holding it there with your stockinged foot and then using this scale to pull back the bow string to exactly your draw length(have someone with a measuring tape there to help you).  Using this scale and the method I just described, keep your string drawn to the draw length of your choice for several seconds and the scale will lock the measurement onto its screen.  Works great.  Nice to have a cheap tool to verify the stats on your bows.  PS:  Use a Dremel tool to do the cutting I described.  You'll risk breaking the scale trying to cut the pieces with pliers or hack saws.  The metal pieces that need to be cut are surprisingly strong.",1135

Easy to use.  I plan to primarily use this to weigh my honey crop - heavy 50 pound buckets of honey.  You don't think it can handle it but it can!
Very simple to use - turn it on, don't put a load on the strap, hold it horizontal.  Then wrap the strap around your item and reconnect it at the swivel.  Once you lift the item you'll see the weight value change, and then flash.  Once done flashing you can put your item down and read the weight at your leisure since it's remembered.  This was important given I had a hard time reading the screen while holding 50 pounds in a weird way.
Not sure if it's a feature or a bug but when getting tare weight of an empty bucket weighing less than 2 pounds I didn't get the flashing followed by a locked weight.  Perhaps it's waiting to weigh more?

248,Devan,Great purchase. Works almost perfectly,0,2017-06-15,5.0,After reading some bad reviews about battery life I was a little scared. Especially because this takes button batteries which I don't keep a stock of. I weighed my bags about 4 times before leaving for vacation (to make sure I was below the 50 lbs. limit at the airport) I did the same thing when returning from vacation and the batteries are still good. I was surprised at how accurate the weight was. I believe only decimal points off. Easy to bring with you. The weight will stay on the screen while you set the bag down which is nice if you can't look down while picking up the bag. I highly recommend this Scale.,617

Once we figured the technique of zeroing and holding the luggage scale steady under the strain of the luggage weight, we got good readings on the luggage scale -- to within 0.5-lb of the weight measured using the bathroom scale. On their trip, my parents made sure to keep packed luggage weight in the 35-38 lb range to make sure that: (1) they could safely lift and move the luggage from the carousel and (2) stay well under the allowed max luggage weight.

I got a brand new scale 2 days before my trip. My trip was 2 weeks long and I would have measured a total of 15 - 20 times (generorously) before the battery ran out. In did not expect the scale to either use that much power or not have enough charge coming straight from the manufacturer. If you buy this do keep a spare set of battery. The battery in the unit does not have sufficient charge.
Another feedback for manufacturer. It is a bit flimsy due to its construction material - cheap plastic. You would feel nervousness in your hand when holding a heavy bag through this scale.",662

You must hold the luggage off the ground and read the weight, which is difficult to do when you're at or above the maximum 50-pound limit.

The handle may not be as nice as my other luggage scale . It doesn't have a backlit screen or a fancy Snap-on clip. But it takes up almost no space at all, so I'll be taking this one with me on trips.
One very nice feature you should be aware of - if you are weighing a heavy bag and need to use both hands, you can just use both hands on the handle and cover up the display. Just hold it still for about 5 Seconds and once the weight settles in the display will hold it for you., if you're only using one hand you can watch the display settle in and blink when it's done.
I tested it with various weights from the seven and a half pound suitcase up to 40 pounds. All six measurements I took were Dead on.
I do have another luggage scale that has a back-lit screen,slightly better handle, and a snap buckle goes around the luggage. But it is 3 times as large, so I prefer to take this one with me.",1013

Whenever I am flying I think of that moment, and I hope not to exceed 50 lbs.
An instruction book accompanies the luggage scale. However, if it had not been noted by another reviewer, I would not have known the battery was in place. A plastic strip covers the battery, and that must be removed so that the digital read out will function.  Follow directions and uncoil the luggage strap,attach the hook to the luggage, press the top button to switch on the scale, when the KCD shows 0, lift the scale gently. When the LCD shows zero, press the UNIT button to convert the weight unit, lbs to kegs. Voila, it is done.
The instruction booklet has a page for responsible disposal of the battery and the digital luggage strap. It is good to read and remind us we need to care for our Enviornment.

Don't try to hang things from the hook; it's not designed for that and won't hold your item most likely. The unit holds the reading after a few seconds and you must press the tare button to reset. Switches between lbs and kg. Nothing fancy, but it's a luggage scale and does the job well.",547
603,N. B. Kennedy,Great little travel scale,0,2016-06-26,4.0,"This little scale is a genius idea! My go-to luggage isn't large and I don't think I could ever exceed the airlines' weight limits, but my spouse's bag is HUGE and could easily be overpacked -- start putting shoes in there and the weight skyrockets. It couldn't be easier to clip this scale onto your bag handle, lift it up and read the weight. You can switch the readout from pounds to kilograms. I was wondering if battery replacement would be a problem, but in the manual it gives you the battery number (CR2032) and you can find them on Amazon; for instance, 
Energizer Watch/Electronic Batteries, 3 Volts, 2032)
. The scale is only 5 inches long, and 1.5 inches wide at its widest point, so you can easily pack it to use for the return trip.",746
604,Mike,Does the job - what's not to like :).,0,2016-06-25,5.0,"Some carriers will not allow you to have single items that weigh more than a certain amount so this is pretty useful device as I have tendency to underestimate the weight of an items.  It requires a watch-style 3V CR2032, which it come with, for power. It's a simple effective way to check luggage is not overweight and weight is evenly distributed among checked items. Simply loop strap through the handle turn on and lift.",424
605,Amazon Customer,Handy,1,2016-06-24,5.0,"This luggage scale will come in very handy this fall, when we take some trips.  It come packed in a cardboard box, with a manual.  It's easy to unpack.  The battery is a cr2032, and is included.  There are 2 buttons, 1 to switch from pounds to kilograms, and one to turn it on/off and zero it.  It's very intuitive to use, and seems to be in line with my bathroom scales readings.",380
606,Jacqueline,Amazon Basics Produces Another Winner,0,2016-06-22,5.0,"I got this from the Vine program to weight luggage before a trip.  The ordinary method is to step onto a bathroom scale empty handed, note the weight, pick up the packed bag, note the weight, subtract.  It works as accurately as the bathroom scale is calibrated to the airline's scale.
I have no idea how well calibrated this Luggage Scale device is to match all the various airline scales -- which I am pretty sure don't match each other.  But in ranges over 5lb's, this scale seems accurate enough.  It does allow you to calibrate with a zero-tare, and to switch units from lb to kg.
It says it weighs objects up to 110 lbs, but I couldn't lift that much.  That is one issue with this type of ""scale"" -- to get the weight of your luggage, you have to LIFT it.
It is powered by a 3V Lithium battery (CR2032) which came inside with a little plastic tab you have to pull -- no quickstart instructions to alert you to that.  The battery compartment is closed with a thumb-slide-forward intuitive cover, so when the device doesn't power up when you push the button on top that has a power symbol, you automatically turn it over looking for the battery compartment wondering if you have any batteries of the right kind.  Nice surprise, it's there and still has power.
The instruction booklet is thick, glossy paper, and contains instructions in 7 languages - English in the front. It looks formidable, but the instructions in English only take up 4 sides. It would have been better if they created the booklet so you could take it apart and keep the language you prefer.
It only has 2 buttons, but different functions (such as tare) are achieved by pressing the button again. The second button toggles lb to kg,  The weight reading flashes 3 times then under it there is the letter H displayed -- you press the power button to reset to 0.0.  It is very intuitive, so just play with it.
The cross-bar unit with the display and battery in it fit nicely in the curve of your fingers, and the strap is sturdy.  You can use this device as a hook to carry a garment bag over your shoulder.  The strap has a metal hook (shown in the Amazon page picture) that is thick, sturdy steel.  It is a rugged little thing that weighs about 3 ounces, and turns itself off after 2 minutes so you won't run down the battery.",2300
607,Greg Ehrbar,Wish I had this years ago,0,2016-06-21,5.0,"I know this sounds like one of those commercials, but:  How many times has this happened to you? You overpack your suitcase, hoping the weight won't go over, but you find yourself over the weight limit and embarrassed as you fumble through your belongings, looking for things to take out? I pack lots of books and they almost always cause this. (Best thing to do is send some things ahead of time to your destination. by the way.)
This is a compact scale that you hook onto your bags. You lift your bad with it, you get a readout and you're done. I wish I had this years ago.",575
608,M. Lee,For more than just luggage,0,2016-06-19,5.0,"When I saw this neat little scale, I knew exactly what I what I wanted it for. It's great for travel, but we often ship books from our home, and our postage scale only goes up to 25 pounds. Now, with the addition of a couple of straps (or strong twine) to hold the box, we can weigh heavier packages right at home and it saves us the inconvenience of standing in line and lugging heavier packages to to the sales counter. GREAT little device. Takes up no storage room. Just keep it in a desk drawer.",499
609,Grimmy,Makes life easier,0,2016-06-17,5.0,"A great little device for weighing your luggage. Much easier than clambering onto a bathroom scale with the luggage and subtracting the difference, which is what we had to do for years 😧 Just remember to lift slowly, don't yank, just in case your bag is beyond the weight limit.",278
610,SBCincinnati,Worried you will find out your luggage is overweight when you get to airport? This product is for you!,27,2016-06-12,5.0," Great product that is easy to use and small enough to easily stick inside your luggage when traveling.  Before using this device the first time you will want to remove the clear plastic tag around the battery.  Once that is done the scale is ready to work. I love the fact that it is so simple to use. Just slip band around luggage handle and clip, hold device horizontally, push power button on and left luggage off the ground. When number flashes three times you have your suitcase's weight. You can set the device to measure in either pounds of kilograms.  The scale is only five inches long, so it fits easily inside a purse, backpack or suitcase. Highly recommend this product to airline travelers.",704
